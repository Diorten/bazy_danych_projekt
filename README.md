You have to create folder in /app titled "/cards_images" and then run function "/skills/send" and "/cards/send" to load everything into database.
If you don't have images in /cards_images you have to download file called cards_images.zip then unpack it into folder: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y0HzD_NRfzGFe9XPLEieelM4JrgWPKE3/view?usp=drive_link
